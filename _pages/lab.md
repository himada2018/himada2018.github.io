## Join the lab! 
Hiro is actively seeking undergraduate/postgraduate students to join his [lab](). 
If you are a current undergraduate/MSc student at Royal Holloway and interested in doing research with him, please contact him via email (Hirotaka.Imada[at]rhul.ac.uk). You can join him as a volunteer research assistant or apply to a research assistant bursary. He can offer you a range of research experiences (e.g., doing literature review, conducting experiments, designing experiments, writing a paper, etc.) 

If you are interested in pursuing a PhD with him, please contact him via email to express your interest with your research idea and financial plans. Please visit [this page](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/psychology/studying-here/research-degrees/) to figure out available PhD funding opportunities. Usually, deadlines for PhD funding applications are around December-January and if you are interested, you'd like to contact him as soon as possible to discuss your project/grant acquisition. 

Hiro is particularly motivated to supervise student-led PhD projects on the following topics: [the psychological foundation of intergroup relations](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/research-and-teaching/departments-and-schools/psychology/studying-here/research-degrees/research-degree-potential-projects/) and intergenerational cooperation (i.e., sustainable behaviour).

For Japanese early career researchers (ECRs): Hiro is more than willing to help Japanese ECRs to come do a PhD/build their career in the UK (regardless of whether they do so with him at Royal Holloway). If you have any questions about PhD/career opportunities in the UK, feel free to contact him. He also offers free English-related consultations for Japanese ECRs (see [this tweet](https://twitter.com/Hiro_IMADA/status/1707291163659502064)).
